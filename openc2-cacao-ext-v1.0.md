# 1 Introduction

_This section is non-normative._

Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) is a schema and
taxonomy for cyber security playbooks. The [[CACAO Security
Playbooks](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)] specification describes how these
playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and
standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions.

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber
defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically uses a request-response
paradigm where a Command is encoded by a Producer (managing application) and
transferred to a Consumer (managed device or virtualized function) using a
secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer can respond with status and any
requested information.

This extension builds on existing CACAO v2.0 OpenC2 features to improve playbook
modularity when using OpenC2 capabilities, and to utilize the current OpenC2
Transfer Specifications for [[MQTT](#openc2-mqtt-v10)] and
[[HTTPS](#openc2-https-v11)].


## 1.1 Glossary

<!-- Optional section with suggested subsections -->

### 1.1.1 Definitions of terms

The [[OpenC2 Architecture](#openc2-arch-v10)] and [[CACAO Security
Playbooks](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)] specifications should be consulted

# 2 Key Concepts & Vocabularies

## 2.1 Key Concepts

_This section is non-normative._

The following key concepts from OpenC2 and CACAO are applicable to this
specification:

* **OpenC2 Command:** An OpenC2 action-target pair, plus other optional
  information, used to command an OpenC2 Consumer.

* **OpenC2 Response:** An OpenC2 message sent from a Consumer to a Producer
  reporting on the outcome of processing a Command.

* **OpenC2 Actuator Profile:** A tailored  subset of the OpenC2 language plus
  any extensions that specifies the use of OpenC2 to command a particular
  function.

* **OpenC2 Transfer Specification:** The description of how an existing standard
  transfer protocol (e.g., MQTT, HTTPS) is used to send and receive OpenC2
  commands and responses.

* **CACAO Action Step:** This type of CACAO workflow step contains commands to
  be executed.

* **CACAO Playbook Action:** This type of CACAO workflow step executes a
  referenced playbook using the agents and targets defined in the referenced
  playbook.

* **CACAO Agents and Targets:** CACAO agents are entities that execute commands
  on or against CACAO targets.

Both OpenC2 and CACAO employ the term "target" but the meanings differ. In this
extension specification, the CACAO target is used to integrate the OpenC2
Actuator Profile concept. The logical flow is as follows:

* An OpenC2 command is defined in a CACAO playbook `openc2` action step
* The `openc2` action step specifies a CACAO agent that supports the desired
  transfer protocol
* The `openc2` action step specifies a CACAO target that represents the AP that
  should process the command.

### 2.1.1 Producers and Consumers

_This section is non-normative._

Both OpenC2 and CACAO employ the terms "producer" and "consumer" but with
different meanings. The following table identifies the relevant definitions,
drawing on the CACAO v2.0 Specification and the OpenC2 Architecture
Specification.

|            | <center>**Producer**<center>| <center>**Consumer**</center> |
|------------|:----------------------------|:------------------------------|
| **OpenC2** | An OpenC2 Producer is a manager application that sends Commands. | An OpenC2 Consumer is a managed device/application that receives commands. |
|  **CACAO** | A "CACAO 2.0 Producer" is any software that can create CACAO 2.0 content and conforms to the requirements of Section 11.1 of the CACAO Specification. | A "CACAO 2.0 Consumer" is any software that can consume CACAO 2.0 content and conforms to the requirements of Section 11.1 of the CACAO Specification. |

Figure 2-1 illustrates how the concepts of producer and consumer apply when
OpenC2 commands are incorporated into CACAO playbooks.

## 2.2 CACAO Vocabulary Modifications

_This section is non-normative._

CACAO employs the concept of vocabularies to improve interoperability. Some
CACAO vocabularies are "open" (designated by `<vocabulary-type>-ov`), which
means that they contain suggested values but that types that employ open
vocabularies can be extended with additional values if needed. This
specification proposes extensions to several open vocabularies from the CACAO
specification:

- `command-type-ov` (CACAO Specification Section 5.2)
- `agent-target-type-ov` (CACAO Specification Section 7.2)
- `variable-type-ov` (CACAO Specification Section 10.18.4)

The specific extended values are:

- `command-type-ov` is extended with the type `openc2` (see [Section&nbsp;3.1](#31-openc2-command-action-step))
  - Command type `openc2-http` is deprecated in favor of the non-transport specific `openc2` command type
- `agent-target-type-ov` "Devices and Equipment" vocabulary is extended with the following types:
  -  `mqtt-broker` agent type for message transfer via MQTT (see [Section&nbsp;4.1.1](#411-mqtt-broker-agent))
  -  `openc2-https` agent type for message transfer via HTTPS (see [Section&nbsp;4.1.2](#412-https-agent)
- `variable-type-ov` is extended with the following types
  - `topic-list` to identify publish / subscribe topics to which a message should be published (see [Section&nbsp;5.1](#51-__mqtt-topics__-variable))

# 3 OpenC2 Commands In CACAO

This section describes the implementation of OpenC2 commands under CACAO,
including the format and processing of an `openc2 ` command object, the handling
of base64 encoding and decoding, and the invocation of OpenC2 via `openc2`
command objects in a subordinate playbook.

This specification recommends deprecating CACAO's `openc2-http` command type in
favor of the transport-neutral `openc2` command type defined here, in keeping
with OpenC2's intent for the language to be defined in a transport-independent
manner.


## 3.1 OpenC2 Command Action Step

> NOTE: Copied in the `openc2-http` command from the CACAO v2.0 spec as a
> starting point

The `openc2` command represents a command that is intended to be processed via
an OpenC2 Consumer. The delivery of the command and specification of transfer
mechanism and desired OpenC2 AP are handled by defining appropriate CACAO agents
and targets. The command type open vocabulary (`command-type-ov`) defined in Section 5.2 of
[[CACAO v2.0](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)] is extended with the new value
`openc2`:

| **Command Type**    |                                         **Description**                                   |
|---------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `openc2`            | An OpenC2 command to be transmitted to an OpenC2 Consumer via an OpenC2 transfer protocol.|

In addition to the inherited properties of a command object defined
in Section 5.1 of [[CACAO v2.0](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)], this section
defines the following additional properties that are valid for this type.

***

> **To-Do:** Should `content_b64` be changed to `command_b64` for consistency
> with virtually all other CACAO command objects?  Opened [issue in CACAO
> repo](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/cacao/issues/12); using `command_b64` for
> now.

***

| **Property Name** | **Data Type** | **Details** |
|---|---|---|
| **type** (required) | `string` | The value of this property **must** be `openc2` |
| **command_b64** (required) | `string` | An OpenC2 command that is base64 encoded (see Section 4 of [RFC 4649]). |
| **step_variables** | `dictionary` | The common workflow `step_variables` property for an `openc2` command **MUST** include an agent for message transfer. That agent **MUST** be one of `mqtt-broker` or `http-api`. |

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3.2 Base64 Encoding and Decoding

CACAO uses base64 encoding, as defined in Section 4 of [[RFC 4648](#rfc4648)], to
preserve the integrity of complex commands and scripts, such as the example
OpenC2 command shown in [Section&nbsp;3.1](#31-openc2-command-action-step). The
default encoding for OpenC2 commands and responses is JSON, as defined in section 3.1.4 of the
[[OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v11)]. The recommended conventions
for the handling of base64 encoding of OpenC2 commands and responses in the
context of a CACAO playbook being executed by a CACAO Consumer are:

- OpenC2 commands in JSON format will be base64 encoded by the CACAO Producer
  creating the playbook and stored as a string in the `command_b64` field of an
  OpenC2 command object.

- The base64-encoded content will be passed to the specified OpenC2 CACAO agent
  when the OpenC2 command object is executed.

- The OpenC2 CACAO agent will decode the base64-encoded content and re-encode in
  the appropriate transfer encoding (e.g., JSON, CBOR) for transfer to the
  Consumer identified by the specified OpenC2 CACAO target. The mechanism for
  exchange of the the transfer-encoded command between agent and target is the
  responsibility of the CACAO Consumer executing the playbook.

- The OpenC2 CACAO agent will accept transfer-encoded responses from the OpenC2
  CACAO target.

***

> **To-Do:** what happens to responses once they are accepted by the OpenC2 CACAO
> agent? Are they base64 encoded? Where do they go? How are they represented
> back to the CACAO Consumer to support any decision(s) that are dependent on
> the response(s)?

***

## 3.3 Invoking OpenC2 via Playbook Action Step

***

> **To-Do:** How much complexity is worthwhile here?
> - Selection of agent based on values in __mqtt-topics__ or __http-endpoints__?
> - Selection of targets based on _something_ that identifies the desired AP?

***

# 4 OpenC2 CACAO Agents and Targets

## 4.1 OpenC2 CACAO Agents

CACAO agents for OpenC2 correspond to OpenC2 transfer specifications. Each type
of OpenC2 CACAO agent supports the use of one transfer protocol for sending
OpenC2 commands and receiving OpenC2 responses.

### 4.1.1 MQTT Broker Agent

An `mqtt-broker` agent type supports publish / subscribe communications via the
OASIS [[MQTT v5](#mqtt-v50)] protocol. The CACAO `agent-target-type-ov` "Devices
and Equipment" subcategory is extended as follows:

| **Type**    |                                     **Description**                                   |
|-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mqtt-broker` | A publish/subscribe message transfer agent conforming to the OASIS MQTT v5.0 protocol.|

The `mqtt-broker` agent is not specific to OpenC2 but when used for sending and
receiving OpenC2 messages its use MUST conform to the [[OpenC2 MQTT Transfer
Specification](#openc2-mqtt-v10)]. In particular:

- Topics for message publication passed to this agent for transmitting OpenC2
messages MUST conform to the default topic structure specified in
Section&nbsp;2.2 of the OpenC2 MQTT Transfer Specification.

- A CACAO `mqtt-broker` agent in an environment using OpenC2 MUST subscribe to
the response topics specified in Section&nbsp;2.2 of the OpenC2 MQTT Transfer Specification.

The `__mqtt-topics__` variable (see
[Section&nbsp;5.1](#51-__mqtt-topics__-variable)) is used to pass the
requested topic(s) for publishing a message to an `mqtt-broker` agent.

This type defines an MQTT Broker agent object and is used for messages to be
transmitted via MQTT. In addition to the inherited properties, this section
defines the following additional properties that are valid for this type.

| **Property Name**                  |      **Data Type**     | **Details**                                          |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **type** (required)                | `string`               | The value of this property **MUST** be `mqtt-broker` |
| **address** (required)             | `dictionary`           | The key for each entry in the dictionary **MUST** be a string that uniquely identifies one or more address types. The key(s) MUST be one of the following values `dname` (domain name), `ipv4`, `ipv6`, `l2mac`, `vlan`, or `url`. The dictionary value associated with each key **MUST** be a `list` of `string` that contains the corresponding address(es) for that particular key type.<br><br>The `address` dictionary for an `mqtt-broker` agent **MUST** specify only a single address for the broker to be used. |
| **authentication_info** (optional) | `identifier`           | This property contains an ID reference to a CACAO `authentication-info` object that is stored at the Playbook level in the **`authentication_info_definitions`** property.<br><br>The ID **MUST** reference a CACAO `authentication-info` object (see section 6 of the [[CACAO v2.0 Specification](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)]). |
| **category** (optional)            | `list` of `open-vocab` | One or more identified categories of security infrastructure types that this agent represents (see section 7.11.1 of the [[CACAO v2.0 Specification](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)]).<br><br>The value for this property **SHOULD** come from the `security-category-type-ov` vocabulary. |


**Example 4.1.1 (MQTT Broker Agent)**<br>
_The IDs used in this example are notional and for illustrative purposes, they do not represent real objects._
```json
"agent_definitions": {
  "mqtt-broker--7125c6f6-7f78-4a3d-8a43-f20d20632305": {
    "type": "mqtt-broker",
    "name": "mqtt.example.com",
    "description": "An MQTT pub/sub broker for company example dot com",
    "address": {
      "url": ["https://mqtt.example.com"]
    },
    "category": "server"
  }
}
```

### 4.1.2 OpenC2 HTTP-API Agent

An `oc2-http-api` agent type supports point-to-point communications via the
HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The CACAO `agent-target-type-ov` "Devices
and Equipment" subcategory is extended as follows:

| **Type**    |                                     **Description**                                   |
|-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `oc2-http-api` | An agent capable of transferring OpenC2 commands to one or more specified endpoints per requirements of the OASIS [[OpenC2 HTTPS Transfer Protocol Specification](#openc2-https-v11)].|

The `oc2-http-api` agent is an extension of the CACAO `http-api` agent to
address the particular requirements for handling OpenC2 messages defined in the
[[OpenC2 HTTPS Transfer Protocol Specification](#openc2-https-v11)]. In
particular:

- The preferred transfer protocols is HTTPS.

- The HTTP message MUST begin with the headers:
  - `POST /.well-known/openc2 HTTP/1.1`
  - `Content-type: application/openc2+json;version=1.0`

- The URL for destinations (i.e., OpenC2 consumers) MUST use the URI scheme
  specified in Section 3.2.2 of the [[OpenC2 HTTPS Transfer Protocol
  Specification](#openc2-https-v11)] (i.e., `https://<consumer address>/.well-known/openc2`).

The `__http-endpoints__` variable (see
[Section&nbsp;5.2](#52-__http-endpoints__-variable)) is used to pass the desired
destinations for transferring an OpenC2 message to an `oc2-http-api` agent.

This type defines an OpenC2 HTTP-API agent object and is used for messages to be
transmitted via HTTP(S). In addition to the inherited properties, this section
defines the following additional properties that are valid for this type.

| **Property Name**                  |      **Data Type**     | **Details**                                          |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **type** (required)                | `string`               | The value of this property **MUST** be `oc2-http-api` |
| **address** (required)             | `dictionary`           | The destination(s) for transfer of this OpenC2 command. The values for `address` are taken from the `__http_endpoints__` variable |
| **authentication_info** (optional) | `identifier`           | This property contains an ID reference to a CACAO `authentication-info` object that is stored at the Playbook level in the **`authentication_info_definitions`** property.<br><br>The ID **MUST** reference a CACAO `authentication-info` object (see section 6 of the [[CACAO v2.0 Specification](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)]). |
| **category** (optional)            | `list` of `open-vocab` | One or more identified categories of security infrastructure types that this agent represents (see section 7.11.1 of the [[CACAO v2.0 Specification](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)]).<br><br>The value for this property **SHOULD** come from the `security-category-type-ov` vocabulary. |


**Example 4.1.1 (OpenC2 HTTP-API)**<br>
_The IDs used in this example are notional and for illustrative purposes, they do not represent real objects._
```json
"agent_definitions": {
  "oc2-http-api--5ceccd83-8052-4d12-8b42-e941647867c7": {
    "type": "oc2-http-api",
    "name": "p2p.example.com",
    "description": "An MQTT pub/sub broker for company example dot com",
    "address": "__http-endpoints__:value",
    "category": "server"
  }
}
```
***

> **To-Do:** Should we define a new `security-category-ov` entry `oc2-consumer`
> or is `server` sufficient?

***

## 4.2 OpenC2 CACAO Targets

OpenC2 CACAO Targets correspond to OpenC2 Actuator Specifications.

***

> **To-Do:** determine what, if anything, needs to be defined beyond the correlation of APs and CACAO Targets.<br>
> **To-Do:** provide examples of CACAO targets for OpenC2 APs

***

# 5 Standard Playbook Variables

A set of standard CACAO variables are defined for use when invoking an MQTT
broker or OpenC2 HTTP API agent to handle message transfer. These CACAO
variables are playbook variables whose values can be set internally via an
`openc2` command object or from a `playbook-action` step in a calling playbook
and accessed by the appropriate agent.

## 5.1 `__mqtt-topics__` Variable

The `__mqtt-topics__` variable is used to convey a list of MQTT topics onto
which a message should be published. The `mqtt-broker` agent is general purpose
and not limited to sending and receiving OpenC2 commands and responses, however
when employed for that purpose the topics specified as `__mqtt-topics__:value`
should conform to the topic structure guidance in Section&nbsp;2.2 of the
[[OpenC2 MQTT Transfer Specification](#openc2-mqtt-v10)].

The `variable-type-ov` is extended as follows:

| Vocabulary Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Examples                                                             |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `topic-list`       | A list of strings that identify one or more publish / subscribe topics to which a message should be published. The format of the topic names should be appropriate to the messaging protocol being invoked.  | `"type": "topic-list",`<br>`"value": ["oc2/cmd/"]` |

**Example 5.1 (`__mqtt-topics__`)**<br>
_The IDs used in this example are notional and for illustrative purposes, they do not represent real objects._*_

```json
{
  "type": "playbook",
  â¦,
  "playbook_variables": {
    "__mqtt-topics__": {
      "type": "topic-list",
      "description": "Provides a list of topics to publish a message via an MQTT broker",
      "value": ["oc2/cmd/ap/pf","oc2/cmd/ap/edr"],
      "constant": false,
      "external": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 5.2 `__http-endpoints__` Variable

The `__http_endpoints__` variable is used to convey a list of endpoints to an OpenC2 command should be published. 

The `variable-type-ov` for `__http-endpoints__` MUST be `dictionary`. 

The value of `__http-endpoints__` MUST be a `dictionary` of address(es) as
defined for the CACAO `http-api` agent object (section 7.8 of the [[CACAO
Playbooks](#cacao-security-playbooks-v20)] specification).

**Example 5.2 (`__http-endpoints__`)**<br>
*The IDs used in this example are notional and for illustrative purposes, they do not represent real objects.*

```json
{
  "type": "playbook",
  â¦,
  "playbook_variables": {
    "__http-endpoints__": {
      "type": "dictionary",
      "description": "A list of endpoints for delivery of an OpenC2 command via HTTP(S)",
      "value": {
        "url": ["https://oc2consumer.example.com"],
        "ipv4" : ["11.22.33.44", "55.66.77.88"]
      },
      "constant": false,
      "external": true
    }
  }
}
```

# 6 Conformance
<!-- Required section -->

(Note: The [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process#wpComponentsConfClause) requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.
For the definition of "conformance clause," see [OASIS Defined Terms](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2017-05-26#dConformanceClause).
